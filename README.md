# Who's That Pokémon? (Prank Edition)

A hilarious prank version of the classic "Who's That Pokémon?" game. This mobile web app is designed to frustrate and amuse your friends!

## The Prank

- Shows a Pokémon silhouette (never Pikachu)
- Presents 4 answer options - **ALL of them say "Pikachu"**
- When the user clicks ANY option (which are all wrong), the app gets "mad" and insults them
- Reveals the actual Pokémon with messages like "NO! That's Clefairy, you idiot!"

## Features

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Fetches real Pokémon data and images from PokéAPI
- 50 different Pokémon to discover (all Gen 1, excluding Pikachu)
- Random sarcastic insults for each wrong answer
- Beautiful gradient UI with shake animations
